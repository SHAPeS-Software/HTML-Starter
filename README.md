# Extra Notes

To edit these files with stuff like autocomplete, you should use an IDE.
If your not new to programming you know what that is, if not a IDE (or Intergrated Development Enviroment) is great for making things, even though NeoVim is awesome
it's NOT for beginners, so you should use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, plus it has extenions and AI coding.

If your more interested in the visual aspects of websites, you want to learn more HTML/CSS, but if you like the logic and backend of websites, you should learn Javascript.

I learned fast with W3Schools so:
- HTML <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3Schools</a>
- CSS <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">W3Schools</a>
- Javascript <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/">W3Schools</a>
